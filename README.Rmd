The goal of MISL (Multiple Imputation by Super Learning) is to create multiply imputed datasets using the super learning framework. This package builds heavily off of the `sl3` and `mice` packages.

You can install the released version of misl from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("misl")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("carpenitoThomas/MISL")
```
## Example

Here's an example with a basic data set.
