# Multiple Imputation by Super Learning (MISL)

[![License: GPL
v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

The goal of MISL (Multiple Imputation by Super Learning) is to create
multiply imputed datasets using the super learning framework. This
package builds heavily off of the `sl3` and `mice` packages.

This method has been submitted for publication and is currently in
review.

## Installation

The MISL algorithm is not yet available on CRAN; instead, please use the
development version available here on Github. To download the
development version use:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("carpenitoThomas/misl")
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example with abalone data in which we use `misl()` imputation
and then pool the results:

``` r
library(misl)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'misl'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:graphics':
#> 
#>     plot
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     plot
set.seed(123)

misl_imp <- misl(abalone, maxit = 5, m = 5, quiet = TRUE,
                  con_method = c("Lrnr_glm_fast", "Lrnr_earth", "Lrnr_ranger"),
                  bin_method = c("Lrnr_earth", "Lrnr_glm_fast", "Lrnr_ranger"),
                  cat_method = c("Lrnr_independent_binomial", "Lrnr_ranger"))

misl_modeling <- lapply(misl_imp, function(y){
  stats::lm(Whole_Weight ~ Sex + Length + Diameter + Height + Older_12, data = y$datasets)
})

summary(mice::pool(misl_modeling), conf.int = TRUE)

We can also look at the traceplot of the imputations as
well:

``` r
plot(misl_imp)
```

This package also supports parallel processing with the `future`
package. One can choose to parallelize either the outside creation of
datasets or the learners in the super learner library (or both\!). The
following snippet explains how this can be accomplished with four
test-case scenarios (with an assumption that our computer has 8 cores):

``` r
library(future)

# Sequential dataset processessing, Sequential super learning  (default)
plan(list(sequential,sequential))
seq_seq <- misl(abalone)

# Sequential dataset processessing, parallel super learning (8) 
plan(list(sequential,tweak(multisession, workers = 8)))
seq_par <- misl(abalone)

# Parallel dataset processessing (8), sequential super learning 
plan(list(tweak(multisession, workers = 5), sequential))
par_seq <- misl(abalone)

# Parallel dataset processessing (4), parallel super learning (2) 
plan(list(tweak(multisession, workers = 4),tweak(multisession, workers = 2)))
par_par <- misl(abalone)

# Parallel dataset processing to ensure you don't overload your computer
plan(list(tweak(multisession, workers = availableCores() %/% 4),tweak(multisession, workers = 4)))
par_safe <- misl(abalone)
```

Reminder, parallel code is not a silver bullet to automate making
runtime processes faster. Make sure you have an understanding of the
capacity of your computer. Further information about the topology of
running code in parallel can be found in the future package.
